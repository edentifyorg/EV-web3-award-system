# NVF Award Core

Backend core functions for the NEVERFLAT award system.

## Overview

This module provides internal functions for:

- CDR normalisation
- Rules-based reward logic calculation
- Award preparation and execution
- Spend validation and execution

Built for Polygon Amoy network integration with the NVF contract.

## Identifier Terminology

This project uses **contract ID** as the primary external identifier for a user.

For backward compatibility, parts of the codebase and schema still use the name `uid` (for example, helper names like `resolveUidToAddress` and the `users.uid` column). In this project, treat `uid` as the contract ID value.

If integrating with another platform, this identifier mapping can be reconfigured to match that system's canonical user key.

## Implementation Status

- ✅ **Reward Orchestrator**: Complete pipeline from raw CDR to on-chain settlement (`processAwardFromCDR`)
- ✅ **Core Normaliser**: OCPI CDR parsing with energy direction detection
- ✅ **Reward Calculation**: JSON-configured rules (off-peak 0.25 tokens/kWh, V2G 1 token/kWh)
- ✅ **Executor Functions**: `prepareAward()`, `executeAward()`, `prepareSpend()`, `executeSpend()`
- ✅ **Award Rules**: Externalized configuration, deduplication key generation
- ✅ **Off-Peak Windows**: Configurable by country (DE, ES, RO: 22:00-06:00)
- ✅ **Contract Integration**: ethers.js setup with token calls
- ✅ **User Accounts**: Deterministic contract ID → Polygon address mapping with auto-enrollment
- ✅ **PostgreSQL Database**: Mirrors blockchain state for API queries
- ✅ **Event Listeners**: Real-time sync from contract to database
- ✅ **Comprehensive Tests**: 54 test cases across all modules, all passing
- ✅ **REST API**: Identity-context and test-mode endpoints for CDR ingestion, spend processing, and wallet queries

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Docker

Build the container image and start the application with PostgreSQL:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

This uses the included `docker-compose.yml` for both the API and PostgreSQL.

### Docker Secrets

The service supports a mounted secret file for the treasury private key via `TREASURY_SIGNER_KEY_FILE`.
In production, use your secret manager or Docker secrets to provide the key at runtime.

## Development Scripts

The `scripts/` directory contains development and testing utilities:

- `capture-pilot-evidence.js` - Captures a timestamped TRL7 pilot evidence JSON file from health, wallet, audit, and reconciliation endpoints
- `load-test-ingest-preview.js` - Captures safe CDR preview throughput evidence without token settlement
- `test-award-and-spend-debug.js` - End-to-end award and spend flow testing
- `test-approval-debug.js` - Manual approval testing
- `test-e2e-flow.js` - Complete end-to-end flow validation
- `test-full-flow.js` - Full system integration test

Run with: `node scripts/<script-name>.js`

For TRL7 evidence capture:

```bash
npm run evidence:pilot
```

By default this is non-destructive and writes `evidence/pilot-evidence-*.json`.
Set `EVIDENCE_RUN_CDR=true` to submit a sample CDR, and
`EVIDENCE_RUN_RECONCILIATION=true` to trigger a reconciliation run during the
capture.

For safe ingestion/rule throughput evidence:

```bash
npm run evidence:load-preview
```

Defaults to 10 preview requests per second for 10 seconds and writes
`evidence/load-test-ingest-preview-*.json`. Override with `LOAD_TEST_RPS`,
`LOAD_TEST_DURATION_SECONDS`, and `LOAD_TEST_CONCURRENCY`.

## Admin UI

The NEVERFLAT admin console is available in `frontend/`.

Run API and UI in two terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1 (API)
npm run api

# Terminal 2 (admin UI)
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

For local development, the admin UI remembers the API URL used at login. When served by Vite on port `3001`, it defaults to `http://localhost:3005`.

## API Identity And Test Modes

The backend supports two access modes:

- **Identity mode (EMP-ready)**: Uses API identity endpoints and resolves contract ID from request header (default `x-contract-id`)
- **Test mode (current integration fallback)**: Allows manual contract ID lookup for testing transactions and wallet flows before EMP is complete

### User Endpoints

- `GET /wallet/me` - Wallet for authenticated/forwarded identity context
- `POST /spend/session` - Non-spending BEAI charging-session SPARKZ prompt
- `POST /spend/me` - Spend for authenticated/forwarded identity context
- `GET /wallet/:uid` - Manual contract ID wallet lookup (legacy/test flow)
- `POST /spend` - Manual contract ID spend (legacy/test flow)

The BEIA charging flow first calls `POST /spend/session` with `x-contract-id`,
then calls `POST /spend/me` only after the user confirms an amount. This creates
a reservation rather than an immediate spend. The EMP's final CDR reaches
NEVERFLAT through the Aarhus database. NEVERFLAT has no direct outbound EMP
connection, so BEIA must retrieve the completed reservation settlement and
forward it to the EMP. The required BEIA-facing reservation-status endpoint is
not yet implemented.

The reusable BEAI React component package lives in
`packages/sparkz-charging-card/`. It is separate from the `frontend/` admin
console bundle.

### BEIA React Package Integration

The BEIA package exports `SparkzChargingCard`.

- BEIA passes the logged-in app user UID as `contractId`
- `UNPLUGGED` mode shows the user's SPARKZ account view via `GET /wallet/me`
- Active session modes call `POST /spend/session` and show the spend prompt
- `POST /spend/me` reserves SPARKZ only after the user confirms an amount
- BEIA must use the same contract, session, and EMP provider identifiers that
  appear in the final Aarhus CDR
- BEIA will retrieve the final settlement from NEVERFLAT and forward it to the EMP
- Custodial wallet mode requires an installed EVM wallet signature before mode switch
- External-wallet reservations request a capped ERC-20 approval at reservation
  time, allowing delayed CDR settlement without a second signature
- BEIA should set the component back to `UNPLUGGED` when the CDR/session close event is received

See `packages/sparkz-charging-card/README.md` for install instructions, props,
state model, and callback examples.

## Award Rules

Award logic is defined in a JSON configuration file (`src/config/awardRules.json`) for easy maintenance and updates:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "rules": {
    "offPeakCharging": {
      "enabled": true,
      "tokensPerKWh": 0.25,
      "description": "1 SPARKZ per 4 kWh"
    },
    "v2gDischarge": {
      "enabled": true,
      "tokensPerKWh": 1,
      "description": "1 SPARKZ per 1 kWh"
    }
  },
  "idempotency": {
    "deduplicationKey": ["sessionId", "providerId"]
  }
}
```

## User Account System

Each contract ID automatically maps to a Polygon wallet address on first use.

### Address Generation

- **Deterministic**: The same contract ID always generates the same address
- **Automatic**: First time a contract ID appears in a CDR, an address is created and registered
- **Configurable**: Address generation uses a salt from the `USER_ADDRESS_DERIVATION_SALT` environment variable

```typescript
import { resolveUidToAddress, isUserRegistered } from 'nvf-award-core';

// Auto-creates address on first call (contract ID value)
const address = resolveUidToAddress('contract-123');

// Subsequent calls return the same address
const sameAddress = resolveUidToAddress('contract-123');
assert(address === sameAddress);

// Check if user has been seen before
const isKnown = isUserRegistered('contract-456');
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```bash
# Treasury wallet address (holds SPARKZ tokens)
TREASURY_ADDRESS=0x605871D30DC278a036F09e2ace771df8a224624B
TREASURY_GAS_WARNING_THRESHOLD_MATIC=0.05

# Optional API key (recommended outside local development)
API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Dedicated CDR ingestion key for AU/provider systems
INGEST_API_KEY=your_ingest_only_secret_here

# Admin login credentials and alert target
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password
ADMIN_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL=https://alerts.example.com/neverflat

# Salt for deterministic contract ID->address mapping
USER_ADDRESS_DERIVATION_SALT=nvf-award-core-v1

# Identity header name used by /wallet/me and /spend/me
USER_IDENTITY_HEADER=x-contract-id

# Keep manual /wallet/:uid lookup enabled for testing
# Set to false when EMP identity integration is fully live or in pilot mode
ENABLE_TEST_UID_LOOKUP=true

# PostgreSQL connection (database that mirrors blockchain)
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/nvf_award
```

## Database

The system uses PostgreSQL to mirror blockchain state for efficient API queries.

### Setup

1. **Start Docker database:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d postgres
   ```

2. **Run migrations:**
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   ```

3. **Stop Docker database when finished:**
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

### Real-time Sync

Event listeners automatically sync blockchain state to the database:

```typescript
import { startEventListener } from 'nvf-award-core';
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.POLYGON_RPC_URL);
await startEventListener(provider);

// Now all Award and Spend events are synced to the database in real-time
```

### Database Queries

```typescript
import { Users, Awards, Balances } from 'nvf-award-core';

// Get user by contract ID
const user = await Users.findByUid('contract-123');

// Get all awards for a user
const awards = await Awards.findByUser(user.id);

// Get current balance
const balance = await Balances.findByUser(user.id);

// Get leaderboard (ordered by total awarded)
const leaders = await Balances.getAll();
```

## Usage

### Complete End-to-End: The Reward Executor

Use `processAwardFromCDR()` for end-to-end orchestration from raw CDR to on-chain settlement:

```typescript
import { processAwardFromCDR } from 'nvf-award-core';

// Raw CDR from charging provider
const ocpiCDR = {
  SessionID: 'a1b09f5b-b75d-4c9e-aef2-4f0c74cc7623',
  ProviderID: 'DE-NWQ',
  EVSEID: 'DE*GUC*E*EZO*0877',
  "Session Start": '2026-02-16T02:00:00Z',  // Off-peak in DE
  "Session End": '2026-02-16T03:00:00Z',
  "Consumed Energy": '40',  // 40 kWh charged
  UID: '0475804AA47330',  // Contract ID from source payload - address auto-resolved from this
};

// Get treasury signer
const treasurySigner = await getTreasurySigner();

// Single function handles all stages:
// 1. Normalise CDR
// 2. Calculate tokens based on rules
// 3. Resolve contract ID (from UID field) -> Polygon address (creates if first time)
// 4. Execute on-chain token transfer
const result = await processAwardFromCDR(ocpiCDR, treasurySigner);

console.log(result);
// {
//   success: true,
//   eligible: true,
//   amount: 10,                  // 40 kWh / 4 = 10 SPARKZ
//   uid: '0475804AA47330',        // Contract ID (legacy field name)
//   dedupKey: 'a1b09f5b-...-DE-NWQ',
//   txHash: '0x123...',          // User received SPARKZ on-chain
//   stage: 'complete'
// }
```

### With Idempotency Checking

Prevent double-processing by checking if the session was already awarded:

```typescript
const treasurySigner = await getTreasurySigner();

const result = await processAwardFromCDR(
  ocpiCDR,
  treasurySigner,
  async (dedupKey) => {
    // Check your DB for existing award
    return await db.awards.exists(dedupKey);
  }
);

if (result.success && result.eligible) {
  // Mark as processed in your database
  await db.awards.create({ dedupKey: result.dedupKey, amount: result.amount });
}
```

### ExecutionResult Structure

```typescript
{
  success: boolean;              // Operation succeeded
  eligible: boolean;             // Deserves a reward
  amount: number;                // SPARKZ tokens
  uid: string;                   // Contract ID (legacy field name)
  dedupKey: string;              // For database lookup
  txHash: string;                // On-chain transaction hash (always present if settled)
  error?: string;                // Error message if failed
  stage: 'normalisation' | 'calculation' | 'validation' | 'execution' | 'complete'
}
```

### Individual Functions (Custom Pipelines)

For more control, use the functions separately:

```typescript
import { 
  normaliseSession, 
  calculateAwardTokens, 
  getDeduplicationKey,
  prepareAward, 
  executeAward 
} from 'nvf-award-core';

const normalised = normaliseSession(rawCDR);
const tokens = calculateAwardTokens(normalised);
const dedupKey = getDeduplicationKey(normalised);
const award = prepareAward(normalised);

if (award.eligible) {
  const txHash = await executeAward(signer, userAddress, award.amount);
}
```

### Normaliser Output Format

```typescript
{
  sessionId: string,
  providerId: string,
  uid: string,                   // Contract ID (legacy field name)
  evseId: string,
  startTime: Date,
  endTime: Date,
  energyKWh: number,        // Always positive (absolute value)
  energyDirection: 'CHARGE' | 'DISCHARGE'
}
```

### Energy Direction

Energy direction is automatically detected from the sign:
- **Positive value** (e.g., `46.593`) → `CHARGE` direction
- **Negative value** (e.g., `-5.25`) → `DISCHARGE` direction

### Reward Calculation Rules

1. **Off-peak Charging**: 1 SPARKZ per 4 kWh (only during off-peak hours)
   - Off-peak windows are country-specific and static
   - Example DE: 22:00 - 06:00
2. **V2G Discharge**: 1 SPARKZ per 1 kWh (always)

### Idempotency

Deduplication uses `(sessionId, providerId)` tuple to prevent double-awarding. The `getDeduplicationKey()` function generates this key for database lookups.

## Contract Details

- Network: Polygon Amoy
- Contract: NVF
- Token: SPARKZ
- Address: 0x605871D30DC278a036F09e2ace771df8a224624B
- Functions: `award(address to, uint256 amount)`, `spend(uint256 amount)`

## Testing

```bash
npm test
```

Test suites:
- Normaliser tests: CDR format handling, field mapping, timestamp parsing
- Award rules tests: Token calculation, off-peak detection, deduplication, edge cases

## Execution

- `prepareAward` and `prepareSpend` handle business logic validation
- `executeAward` and `executeSpend` perform on-chain transactions
- Requires appropriate signers (treasury for awards, user for spends)
